### Word Frequency

---

A program I made to help me with text analysis    

Input: a text file containing some text   

Output: word frequency sorted alphabetically & by frequency (descending)

#### Usage:

word-frequency

​	*- enter input_file and output_file interactively*

word-frequency \<input_file>

​	*- enter input_file interactively, output_file will be 'wfout.txt'*

word-frequency \<input_file> <output_file>

​	*- specify both input_file and output_file*
